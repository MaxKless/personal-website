        For my bachelor thesis at
        <a href="https://www.fmi.uni-jena.de/en/">FSU Jena</a>, I used reinforcement learning (specifically, Proximal
        Policy Optimization) to teach virutal cars how to navigate a simulated road network.

          Reinforcement learning has been an active area of research for more than a decade and continues to evolve.
          This bachelor thesis applies reinforcement learning to the problem of controlling virtual agents in an urban
          traffic simulation. It successfully implements learning agents using Proximal Policy Optimization, a
          specifically designed curriculum and different approaches to reward shaping in an existing road generation and
          simulation Unity library called Eltrilo. The thesis will explain the necessary theoretical background
          regarding neural networks and reinforcement learning, detail the implementation of learning agents and conduct
          experiments using multiple agent configurations as well as provide an outlook over possible modifications.
          Furthermore, an analysis of the systemâ€™s performance will be provided, concluding that while agents learn to
          navigate the environment well, reinforcement learning exhibits several key weaknesses that make it suboptimal
          for urban traffic simulation: long training times, high computational intensity and poor control over specific
          agent behaviour.
