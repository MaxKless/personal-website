      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        Reinforcement learning has been an active area of research for more than
        a decade and continues to evolve. This bachelor thesis applies
        reinforcement learning to the problem of controlling virtual agents in
        an urban traffic simulation. It successfully implements learning agents
        using Proximal Policy Optimization, a specifically designed curriculum
        and different approaches to reward shaping in an existing road
        generation and simulation Unity library called Eltrilo. The thesis will
        explain the necessary theoretical background regarding neural networks
        and reinforcement learning, detail the implementation of learning agents
        and conduct experiments using multiple agent configurations as well as
        provide an outlook over possible modifications. Furthermore, an analysis
        of the systemâ€™s performance will be provided, concluding that while
        agents learn to navigate the environment well, reinforcement learning
        exhibits several key weaknesses that make it suboptimal for urban
        traffic simulation: long training times, high computational intensity
        and poor control over specific agent behaviour.
